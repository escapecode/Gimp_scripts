# Overview

This Gimp Scripts repository contains useful Gimp add-ons and Script-Fu scripts.  Script-Fu .scm scripts can be used by downloading them and putting them in a folder that is defined in Gimp under
Edit > Preferences > Folders > Scripts

If you update a .scm file while Gimp is loaded (and don't want to restart Gimp) use Filters > Script-Fu > Refresh Script.
